# Note-Taker

## Description

* This application, which builds upon front-end starter code, is used to write and save notes using an express.js back-end. 


## Goals

* This is my first experience building the back end, connecting to the already existing front end from starter code, and deploying the entire application to Heroku.


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
[IN PROGRESS] WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
[IN PROGRESS] THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
